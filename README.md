# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge

## Background 
In this challenge, a dataset contained various cryptocurrencies and fluctuations of their values over periods of time: 24 h, 7 d, 14 d, 30 d, 60 d, 200 d, and 1 y. K-means testing was applied to the dataset to determine if those cryptocurrencies are affected by 24 h or 7 d price changes.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was then utilized to determine if features can be reduced from the original data set while retaining the variance for clustering. 

## Analysis

An elbow curve analysis indicates the optimal value of k for a K-means test is k = 4.

The PCA-optimized dataset similarly returns an optimal k value of k = 4 for K-means testing. Moreover, PCA analysis using n = 3 components returned an explained variance of 0.3719856 , 0.34700813, and 0.17603793 for the 3 components. This yields a total variance of 0.89503166. In other words, 89% of the variance in the data set is explained via those three principal components.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to reduce features in a data set as a method to reduce the resources needed when using machine learning. In this particular case,the PCA optimized data showed no difference in the optimal value of k when compared to the original data set. Both PCA and original data set elbow-curves indicate an optimal value of k = 4. 

However, what PCA did offer is a cleaner scatter plot where the data was more distinctly grouped into two clusters (red and blue) with two other clusters (yellow and green) containing a single data point each indicating outliers. In contrast, the original unoptimized data's clustering was more dispersed and therefore confusing. This made clustering into distinct discrete groups more difficult.
